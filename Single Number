The problem:
 Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single
 one.


Thoughts
 The key to solve this problem is bit manipulation. XOR will return 1 only on two
 different bits. So if two numbers are the same, XOR will return 0. Finally only one
 number left.


public int singleNumber(int[] A) {
int x=0;
 for(int a: A){
 x = x ^ a;
 }
 return x;
}
