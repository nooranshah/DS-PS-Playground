Data Structures Commonly Asked in Interviews
When preparing for technical interviews, having a strong understanding of data structures is essential. Many interview questions are designed to test how well candidates know various data structures and can apply them to solve problems efficiently. Here’s a breakdown of some key data structures you should be familiar with:

1. Arrays
An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. It allows random access to elements, making it efficient for retrieving elements if the index is known.

Time Complexity:

Access: O(1)
Insertion: O(n)
Deletion: O(n)
Common Questions:

Find the missing number in an array.
Rotate an array by n positions.
Merge two sorted arrays.
2. Linked Lists
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object known as a node. Each node contains two parts: data and a reference to the next node.

Types of Linked Lists:

Singly Linked List
Doubly Linked List
Circular Linked List
Time Complexity:

Access: O(n)
Insertion: O(1) (at head or tail)
Deletion: O(1) (if node is known)
Common Questions:

Detect a cycle in a linked list.
Reverse a linked list.
Merge two sorted linked lists.
3. Stacks
A stack is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure. It has two main operations: push (to insert data) and pop (to remove data).

Time Complexity:

Push: O(1)
Pop: O(1)
Common Questions:

Implement a stack using arrays or linked lists.
Check for balanced parentheses in an expression.
Evaluate postfix expressions.
4. Queues
A queue is a FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure. Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

Types of Queues:

Simple Queue
Circular Queue
Priority Queue
Deque (Double-Ended Queue)
Time Complexity:

Enqueue: O(1)
Dequeue: O(1)
Common Questions:

Implement a queue using two stacks.
Design a circular queue.
Implement a priority queue using a heap.
5. Hash Tables (Hash Maps)
A hash table is a data structure that stores data in an associative manner. It maps keys to values using a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets.

Time Complexity:

Access: O(1) (average case)
Insertion: O(1)
Deletion: O(1)
Common Questions:

Find the first non-repeating character in a string.
Implement a hash map from scratch.
Count the frequency of elements in an array.
6. Trees
A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, with each node having zero or more child nodes. The most common type is the binary tree, where each node has at most two children.

Types of Trees:

Binary Tree
Binary Search Tree (BST)
AVL Tree
Red-Black Tree
Heap (Max Heap, Min Heap)
Time Complexity:

Access: O(log n) (for balanced trees)
Insertion: O(log n)
Deletion: O(log n)
Common Questions:

Implement a binary search tree (BST).
Find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) in a binary tree.
Check if a binary tree is balanced.
7. Graphs
A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes. Graphs can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted.

Time Complexity: (depends on representation)

Adjacency Matrix: O(V^2)
Adjacency List: O(V + E)
Common Questions:

Implement depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).
Find the shortest path using Dijkstra’s algorithm.
Detect cycles in a directed graph.
8. Heaps
A heap is a special tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In a max heap, the parent node is always greater than or equal to the child nodes. In a min heap, the parent node is always less than or equal to the child nodes.

Time Complexity:

Access (min/max): O(1)
Insertion: O(log n)
Deletion: O(log n)
Common Questions:

Find the kth largest element in an array.
Merge k sorted linked lists.
Implement a priority queue using a heap.
9. Tries (Prefix Trees)
A trie is a type of search tree used to store a dynamic set of strings, where each node represents a character of a string.

Time Complexity:

Insertion: O(n) (where n is the length of the word)
Search: O(n)
Common Questions:

Implement a trie for dictionary operations.
Auto-complete functionality using a trie.
Count the number of words with a given prefix.
10. Dynamic Arrays (e.g., ArrayList in Java)
Dynamic arrays are similar to arrays, but they can grow and shrink in size as needed.

Time Complexity:

Access: O(1)
Insertion: O(n) (amortized O(1))
Deletion: O(n)
Common Questions:

Design a dynamic array.
Implement your own version of a dynamic array.
